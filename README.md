# About The Project

  

<img src="https://github.com/akshat-kumar2109/helping-hand-backend/blob/main/img/helpinghandmockup.png" alt="helpinghandmockup" width="75%">

Current estimates are that nearly 690 million people are hungry, or 8.9 percent of the world population. Over 20 crore Indians go to sleep empty-stomach every day. Also, According to a UN report which said that household food waste  in India is estimate to 50 kg per capita per year, or 68.7 million tonnes a year.

THis project 'Helping Hand' provide a solution which will help in solve these two major problems simultaneously. Every household in the world will always have some leftover food. And most of these ends up in garbage the next day. This project providing a platform to list these food items. So, instead of wasting the food, It can be provided to the people who needs it most i.e. the people living on streets and are starving everyday. By this eventually we can move towards the goal of 'ZERO HUNGER', also reducing food wastage at the same time.


  
### Features of this Project
-  User can add their remaining/leftover food items. User's food will be added to his list as well as the list which is available publicly for all the users.
- User can select his/her desire items for delivering it, and get direction from his/her current location to the food's location.
- User's current location will be automatically picked after user's approval.
- It also has a reward system, for every successful food listing, user will get 10 reward points or RP and for every successful food delivery user will get 30 points.
- In the redeem section, user can claim different available products with his reward points. This will work as a motivation for user to list or deliver as much food as possible.
